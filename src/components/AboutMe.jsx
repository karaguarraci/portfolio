      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          With a background in teaching in a special needs school it has given
          me a range of skills and a high level of resilience that I feel would
          aid me in future employment. I have always had a keen interest in
          technology, from gaming at an early age, being the first in the family
          to own a computer and being the person people always came to to solve
          any problem. The solving of technical problems, systematically
          troubleshooting and researching to find a solution, was something I
          found greatly rewarding and a skill I believe makes me well suited to
          a career in software engineering.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Although I have thoroughly enjoyed my teaching career, my interest in
          technology and desire to always figure things out has helped me come
          to the decision of changing careers. I decided to enrol into a
          software engineering immersive course to develop the skills I need to
          make this change and am looking to start my career in the tech
          industry as a junior developer, at a company where I can continue to
          learn and build on my knowledge and skills.
